00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,339
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Cloud Code is now available on the web.<|3.34|>

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,279
<|3.34|> So instead of loading up your terminal<|5.28|>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,199
<|5.28|> or having to open up your IDE<|7.20|>

4
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:08,880
<|7.20|> anytime you want to make a change,<|8.88|>

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,840
<|8.88|> you can now delegate coding tasks<|10.84|>

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,779
<|10.84|> directly from your browser or the Cloud Mobile app.<|13.78|>

7
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,699
<|13.78|> You simply connect your GitHub account<|15.70|>

8
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:21,299
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> you select your repo describe what you need done and claude handles the rest all running on our<|5.60|>

9
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:27,540
<|5.60|> cloud infrastructure and the best part is you can now run multiple tasks in parallel across different<|11.84|>

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,259
<|11.84|> repositories so whether you have a bug backlog routine fixes or a brilliant new idea or feature<|18.56|>

11
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:40,020
<|18.56|> you want to add you can just spin up a session or multiple sessions and let claude handle them<|24.32|>

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,500
<|24.32|> simultaneously let me show you how this works so i'll open up<|28.80|>

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,720
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> cloudcode on the web at claw.ai slash code. I'll select a repo. I have a repo already selected here<|7.22|>

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,900
<|7.22|> and then I'll give it a prompt. Let's say add input validation to the user registration endpoint<|15.40|>

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:12,080
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Also make sure we're using a strong password on both the front end and back end API.<|12.18|>

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
<|12.18|> We'll hit enter and we are off the races.<|15.62|>

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,459
<|15.62|> Claude is working in his own isolated sandbox with full git access and we can watch the<|20.56|>

18
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,300
<|20.56|> progress in real time.<|22.40|>

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,400
<|22.40|> But while this runs.<|23.50|>

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,559
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> let me tell you about some of the other stuff that we've recently launched.<|3.16|>

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,800
<|4.18|> The big one is Claude Haiku 4.5.<|7.40|>

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,580
<|7.72|> And a few weeks ago, we launched Claude Sonnet 4.5,<|11.18|>

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,699
<|11.28|> which became the world's best coding model.<|13.30|>

24
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:40,900
<|13.52|> And just last week, we followed it up with Claude Haiku 4.5.<|17.50|>

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> And here's the really remarkable thing:<|2.00|>

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,300
<|2.00|> 5 months ago, Sonnet 4 was state of the art.<|5.40|>

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,300
<|5.40|> And now, Haiku 4.5 gives you a similar coding performance<|10.40|>

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,300
<|10.40|> at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed.<|13.40|>

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,800
<|13.40|> It even surpasses Sonnet 4 at certain tasks like computer use.<|17.90|>

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,900
<|17.90|> Now, the benchmarks are impressive: 73.3% on SweetBench Verified,<|23.00|>

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,300
<|23.00|> 41% on TerminalBench,<|25.40|>

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,300
<|25.40|> and it achieves 90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance<|29.40|>

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,979
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> in agentic coding evaluations.<|2.68|>

34
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,419
<|2.68|> But the big question you're probably having is<|5.12|>

35
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,139
<|5.12|> when should developers use Haiku 4.5?<|7.84|>

36
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,119
<|7.84|> And the big pattern that we're seeing from our community<|10.82|>

37
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:24,040
<|10.82|> is that Sonnet 4.5 does the high level<|13.74|>

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,100
<|13.74|> problem decomposition and planning and then Haiku<|16.80|>

39
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,620
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> 4.5 is used to actually implement and write the code. Now this multi-agent<|5.52|>

40
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,060
<|5.52|> approach is becoming really popular for things like large-scale refactors or<|9.96|>

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,639
<|9.96|> tackling technical death. Haiku 4.5 is available wherever you get your clod and<|15.54|>

42
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,880
<|15.54|> it's available at just $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output<|20.78|>

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,700
<|20.78|> tokens. Alright let's check<|22.60|>

44
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:56,580
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> back on our task and see how it's doing. So if we open it up here we can see that<|6.88|>

45
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,899
<|6.88|> Claude gave us a good summary of all of the changes that it made in the service.go file,<|13.20|>

46
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:09,699
<|13.20|> in the TypeScript on the front end and my absolute favorite feature of Claude code on the web is this<|20.00|>

47
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:17,699
<|20.00|> open in CLI button and the reason that I really like it is you simply click it, you open up your terminal<|28.00|>

48
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,720
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.84|> paste in the command that it gave you.<|3.02|>

49
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,199
<|4.18|> And now I am working in my local development environment with all of the<|8.50|>

50
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,039
<|8.50|> context and all of my progress from the web preserve.<|11.34|>

51
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,679
<|11.58|> So I can see the messages.<|13.98|>

52
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,199
<|14.00|> I can see all of the files that have been changed.<|16.50|>

53
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:39,660
<|16.98|> I can go into VS code and see all of the changes that were made to the<|21.96|>

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,460
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> the signup.type script file and much more and i can continue right from where i left off on my<|5.36|>

56
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,700
<|5.36|> mobile phone or the browser now i want to show you one final feature that we recently added to clot<|11.60|>

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:01,500
<|11.60|> code i gave it this prompt earlier talking about adding caching to my application but i gave it a<|20.40|>

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,900
<|20.40|> very broad prompt saying hey i would like to add caching to my application and what clot code did is<|26.80|>

59
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:13,099
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> it's going to ask me a number of follow-up questions to make sure that it implements it correctly.<|5.20|>

60
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:19,100
<|5.20|> So it's going to ask the caching level here, should it be database query caching, API response caching,<|11.20|>

61
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,100
<|11.20|> and I can choose any of these, go to the next section and figure out what my goals are.<|16.20|>

62
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:31,000
<|16.30|> Is it to improve performance, reduce database load, the target area, is it for the workout data, for the user data,<|23.10|>

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,239
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> analytics choose the technology redis in memory postgres and then i can hit submit and have it<|8.24|>

64
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:43,399
<|8.24|> go and implement based on the follow-up information that i gave it<|12.40|>

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,200
<|14.32|> and there you have it cloud code on the web for parallel cloud-based development at home<|19.20|>

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,399
<|19.20|> and on the go haiku 4.5 for lightning fast coding at a fraction of the cost<|24.40|>

67
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,720
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> and smarter local workflows with multi-question support.<|3.32|>

68
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,679
<|4.00|> Cloud Code on the Web is available now for pro and max users at cloud.ai slash code.<|9.28|>

69
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,419

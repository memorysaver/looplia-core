<|20.16|> NICK LYNN: Awesome. So Nick, my first question for you is,<|22.40|>

20

<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> How do you feel about the shift in the AI landscape<|3.00|>

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,340
<|3.00|> for financial services these days?<|4.54|>

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,480
<|4.54|> You know, I've been with Anthropic<|6.68|>

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,300
<|6.68|> for a little bit over a year and a half now.<|9.50|>

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,319
<|9.50|> That was before CLOG3.<|11.52|>

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,740
<|11.52|> So I think the enterprise AI landscape<|13.94|>

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,520
<|13.94|> has changed significantly,<|15.72|>

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
<|15.72|> especially in the past few months.<|17.72|>

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,060
<|17.72|> What I am really noticing is that<|19.26|>

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,200
<|19.26|> there is a fundamental shift<|21.40|>

30
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:30,459
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> from curiosity, observing from the sidelines,<|4.26|>

31
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,759
<|4.26|> to actually starting to build and deploy into production.<|8.56|>

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,339
<|8.56|> Now, as we all know, coding is one of the first products<|12.14|>

33
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:42,379
<|12.14|> and first domains within AI with really strong product market fit.<|16.18|>

34
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,419
<|16.18|> I think we're starting to see this really extend to other verticals as well,<|20.22|>

35
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:47,479
<|20.22|> including finance.<|21.28|>

36
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,219
<|21.28|> For example, Mbin or the Norwegian Saoan Wealth Fund,<|25.02|>

37
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,299
<|25.02|> one of our largest customers,<|27.10|>

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,800
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> they have about 9,000 portfolio companies.<|2.50|>

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,020
<|2.88|> What they've done is they've built integrations on their own<|5.72|>

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,260
<|5.72|> with things like model context protocol<|7.96|>

41
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,639
<|7.96|> so that all of their portfolio managers<|10.34|>

42
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,920
<|10.34|> are querying these integrations every single day<|13.62|>

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,400
<|13.62|> to get insights into their portcos.<|16.10|>

44
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:28,099
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> So I think we're really starting to see analysts spend a lot less time on the mundane, manual, tedious parts of the work and start to focus on what they really care about, you know, which is building relationships, meeting with their customers and actually understanding the business models of the companies they're investing in.<|18.70|><|endoftext|>

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,139
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Yeah, that really resonates from my standpoint as well as an applied AI person.<|5.04|>

46
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,340
<|5.04|> Whenever I go and interact with customers, a lot of the time, last year let's say,<|10.24|>

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,340
<|10.24|> they would start with building an AI chat feature.<|13.24|>

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,059
<|13.24|> Like they'd have a bunch of models represented and they would select one,<|16.96|>

49
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:49,400
<|16.96|> maybe a random business user, and they would try to work with it and just chat with it.<|21.30|>

50
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:55,899
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Eventually, now we've seen things like MCP come out, where the chat has become so much more powerful.<|6.50|>

51
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,139
<|6.86|> You can interact with the systems you care about.<|8.74|>

52
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:05,500
<|9.08|> And I think that's really exciting, specifically for finance, because often there are just so many product surfaces that folks have to interact with.<|16.10|>

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,740
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> - 100%.<|1.24|>

54
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,160
<|1.24|> - If you give a model a tool these days,<|3.66|>

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,300
<|3.66|> often the model's intelligent enough to know<|5.80|>

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,380
<|5.80|> what that tool does given the tool description<|7.88|>

57
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,520
<|7.88|> and the tool name.<|9.02|>

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,279
<|9.02|> But equally, the model has certain primitives baked into it,<|11.78|>

59
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,619
<|11.78|> like the security that we try to bake into the way<|15.12|>

60
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,100
<|15.12|> the model interacts with the world.<|16.60|>

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,279
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> So we train our models to be helpful, harmless, and honest.<|3.18|>

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,360
<|3.82|> And often that's a reflection of the data that they interpret and the output that it basically corresponds to.<|9.26|>

63
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,740
<|9.56|> I think that's probably what you're referring to as well in that like the model is generally intelligent.<|13.64|>

64
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,720
<|13.96|> And so if you give it these different layers, you can really see some cool results.<|17.62|>

65
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,779
<|17.86|> You know, safety is something that you touched upon.<|19.68|>

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,800
<|19.80|> That is so important.<|20.70|>

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> foundational to everything we do.<|3.00|>

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,139
<|3.00|> It's about securely deploying these solutions<|5.34|>

69
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,600
<|5.34|> into enterprise environments.<|6.80|>

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,300
<|6.80|> It's about making sure that the models can accurately<|9.50|>

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,479
<|9.50|> answer the questions with the right level of understanding<|12.68|>

72
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,639
<|12.68|> of those problems and fidelity.<|14.84|>

73
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,619
<|14.84|> And third is actually giving our users the trust,<|18.82|>

74
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:04,119
<|18.82|> the verification, the auditability<|21.32|>

75
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,699
<|21.32|> to understand these results.<|22.90|>

76
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,199
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> So I think we think about all three of those components of safety.<|2.50|>

77
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,500
<|2.50|> Yeah, I mean, speaking of, right,<|4.80|>

78
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,119
<|4.80|> Anthropic was founded on the principles of AI safety.<|8.42|>

79
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,260
<|8.42|> It was a research org from scratch.<|10.56|>

80
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,799
<|10.56|> I'm curious, how have we gone from being a research org<|14.10|>

81
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,639
<|14.10|> to releasing a distinguished product in financial services?<|17.94|>

82
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,799
<|17.94|> In my mind, Anthropic really aims at building models<|23.10|>

83
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,559
<|23.10|> that can be safely deployed to solve the most complex<|26.86|>

84
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,000
<|26.86|> and difficult problems in the world.<|29.30|>

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Right? We're state of the art when it comes to code.<|4.00|>

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
<|4.00|> 0.5% of the world's population are software engineers.<|9.00|>

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
<|9.00|> So that is just one sliver of these really complex, difficult problems we can really start solving, right?<|16.00|>

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
<|16.00|> They really exist everywhere else in the world.<|18.00|>

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
<|18.00|> Code is so foundational to every single part of a company, right?<|22.00|>

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
<|22.00|> It is how a company is run.<|24.00|>

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,440
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> So that means that Cloud is really great at interacting with more complex systems,<|6.44|>

92
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,559
<|6.44|> being able to expose thinking and its logic.<|9.56|>

93
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,399
<|9.56|> And that's why it's great at finance as well.<|11.40|>

94
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:17,200
<|11.40|> Finance are complex problems deployed into regulated verticals that need verification, auditability,<|18.20|>

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Ultimately, accuracy really matters.<|3.00|>

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,400
<|3.00|> Financial analysts these days spend a lot of time getting down to like the pixel perfect level of,<|8.20|>

97
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,400
<|8.20|> let's say a PowerPoint deck or an Excel model, right? You can't get anything wrong.<|12.20|>

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,000
<|12.20|> And it's funny now that we're in this paradigm where models can do something similar,<|16.80|>

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,700
<|16.80|> but using the capabilities they have to write really structured logic.<|21.50|>

100
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,800
<|21.50|> And so that's actually what we found language models to be good at.<|24.60|>

101
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,359
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> what we've trained them on.<|1.56|>

102
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,239
<|1.56|> And that ability to do that,<|3.44|>

103
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,639
<|3.44|> it feels like it's just being abstracted<|5.84|>

104
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,339
<|5.84|> into so many other domains,<|7.54|>

105
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,979
<|7.54|> like creating Excel spreadsheets<|9.18|>

106
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,779
<|9.18|> or like creating PowerPoints.<|10.98|>

107
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:57,039
<|11.94|> And so, yeah, it's just been like super kind of striking,<|15.24|>

108
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,759
<|15.24|> at least to me, to see how many domains<|17.96|>

109
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,259
<|17.96|> the logic and reasoning of these models<|20.46|>

110
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,479
<|20.46|> actually ends up touching.<|21.68|>

111
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,579
<|21.68|> - Ultimately, these are digital systems<|23.78|>

112
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,699
<|23.78|> that we interact with every single day, right?<|25.90|>

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:16,340
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> The fact that Cloud is great at code gives it a flexible skill and a shortcut to do all of these really cool interesting things, right?<|8.64|>

<|10.52|> and gathering insights.<|11.60|>

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,459
<|11.60|> It can read 5,000 probably times faster than humans.<|14.56|>

129
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,220
<|14.56|> But what we want to do with finance is making sure that these systems<|18.32|>

130
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,019
<|18.32|> can connect to all of the core data sources that finance analysts work in.<|23.12|>

131
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,899
<|23.12|> In finance, the ability to uncover insights<|27.00|>

132
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,059
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> faster than your competitors and your peers,<|3.16|>

133
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:30,739
<|3.16|> that's really key advantage.<|4.84|>

134
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,299
<|4.84|> Now downstream from that,<|6.40|>

135
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,500
<|6.40|> it's great that we can retrieve this information<|8.60|>

136
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,579
<|8.60|> and connect to it,<|9.68|>

137
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,679
<|9.68|> but the ability to do analysis at scale,<|12.78|>

138
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,600
<|12.78|> either through code or through spreadsheets<|15.70|>

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,079
<|15.70|> is so foundational as well.<|17.18|>

140
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,600
<|17.18|> Financial models themselves, they're not just these<|19.70|>

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,279
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> beautiful Excel sheets, right?<|2.68|>

142
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,200
<|2.68|> They're a way for finance analysts<|4.60|>

143
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,279
<|4.60|> to inject their own judgment of what the future looks like<|8.68|>

144
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,959
<|8.68|> and what the proper valuation looks like<|10.36|>

145
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,300
<|10.36|> for that company, right?<|11.70|>

146
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,679
<|11.70|> So with that in mind,<|13.08|>

147
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,040
<|13.08|> we want Claude to be really good<|14.44|>

148
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,320
<|14.44|> at understanding these core finance concepts<|16.72|>

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,619
<|16.72|> and manipulate systems like Excel and spreadsheets<|20.02|>

150
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,380
<|20.02|> to be able to do that calculation.<|21.78|>

151
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,800
<|21.78|> And then the third part is creation, right?<|24.20|>

152
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:13,799
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> We're all social creatures within the enterprise, right?<|4.00|>

153
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,299
<|4.00|> We do our work to be shared with others.<|6.50|>

154
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:19,799
<|6.50|> So the outputs themselves in the form of spreadsheets,<|10.00|>

155
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,299
<|10.00|> PowerPoint documents, Word,<|12.50|>

156
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:25,000
<|12.50|> doing this in a way that is client ready,<|15.20|>

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,180
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> boardroom ready is really important.<|2.98|>

158
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,080
<|2.98|> So we really want to start pushing Clause capabilities<|5.88|>

159
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,299
<|5.88|> to be able to do that as well,<|7.10|>

160
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,940
<|7.10|> so that it is an end-to-end agentic autonomous system.<|11.74|>

161
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,780
<|11.74|> - That makes a lot of sense.<|12.58|>

162
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
<|12.58|> I feel like we build these primitives<|14.58|>

163
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,739
<|14.58|> and then they almost end up snowballing.<|16.54|>

164
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:44,059
<|16.54|> So you have like the retrieval step, right?<|18.86|>

165
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,900
<|18.86|> You build an MCP server to connect to one system.<|21.70|>

166
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,740
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> But then if you take the data from that system, maybe it connects to some other system in a<|3.84|>

167
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,700
<|3.84|> unique way. Like you get data from Snowflake, let's say. You find an ID in there and you<|8.80|>

168
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,220
<|8.80|> need to connect it to your Salesforce instance. You can easily do that with some of those<|13.32|>

169
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,800
<|13.32|> primitives that we've built on the retrieval side. But then it sort of continues to snowball. You get<|17.90|>

170
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,419
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> analysis where Claude can write a bunch of code and essentially piece together some of that<|5.62|>

171
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:15,320
<|5.62|> information. And then finally, the creation is even take that one step further and put it into<|10.52|>

172
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,119
<|10.52|> the environment that someone cares about, sending that post request back to the API example to a<|16.32|>

173
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:26,539
<|16.32|> system where an analyst or an operator can see the information that Claude has reasoned through.<|21.74|>

174
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,500
<|21.74|> So let's talk a little bit more about<|23.70|>

175
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,380
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> what is actually a cloud for finance?<|1.88|>

176
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,299
<|1.88|> How does it work?<|2.80|>

177
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,460
<|2.80|> What makes it so special?<|3.96|>

178
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
<|3.96|> - So there are three layers<|5.96|>

179
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,940
<|5.96|> that we think about in our solution.<|8.44|>

180
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,359
<|8.44|> The models, the agent capabilities, and the platform.<|11.86|>

181
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,479
<|11.86|> Starting with the models themselves.<|13.98|>

182
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:45,200
<|13.98|> Fundamentally, we are a research lab.<|16.70|>

183
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,400
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Everything we do really aims at making cloud the best model for financial services.<|6.20|>

184
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,640
<|6.20|> Now, finance presents some interesting challenges to us.<|10.44|>

185
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,960
<|10.44|> Code is something that we can test every single day as software engineers and product managers.<|14.76|>

186
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,799
<|14.76|> But there are very few investment bankers within these four walls of Anthropik.<|19.60|>

187
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,519
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Here's where we're really excited to work with early customers like BCI,<|4.72|>

188
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,559
<|4.72|> Pearl at Weinberg, and NBIM to really let us know what are the use cases they really care about,<|10.76|>

189
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,719
<|10.76|> what does good look like, and then help us, much more importantly,<|14.92|>

190
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,959
<|14.92|> uncover those gaps that we can bring back into the research process.<|19.16|>

191
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,839
<|19.16|> The second thing is on the product side, right?<|22.04|>

192
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,200
<|22.04|> Agenda capabilities are essentially the code that we write<|25.40|>

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,500
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> to enable users to interact with the models.<|3.30|>

194
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,040
<|3.30|> We've built capabilities like deep research.<|5.84|>

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,000
<|5.84|> Now we're really investing in being able to embed Cloud<|9.80|>

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,299
<|9.80|> in all of the core surfaces you work in.<|12.10|>

197
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,919
<|12.10|> Not just Cloud for Enterprise, Cloud AI,<|14.72|>

198
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,500
<|14.72|> but also the browser extension, Excel,<|18.30|>

199
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,179
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Chrome, and other services that our analysts and enterprise customers work with every single day.<|5.68|>

200
00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:02,979
<|5.68|> The last piece is we want to again build a really flexible platform that can be tailored and deployed very easily for our customers.<|14.48|>

201
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:13,099
<|14.48|> That's why we've been spending a lot of time with industry partners like S&P, FactSet, PitchBook to build these integrations so that these agents can be as powerful as possible.<|24.60|>

202
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,799
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> So I'm curious, how has adoption been, right?<|2.70|>

203
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,859
<|2.70|> Who's using this?<|3.76|>

204
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,559
<|3.76|> Why are they excited about it?<|5.46|>

205
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,399
<|5.46|> Walk us through that.<|6.30|>

206
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,339
<|6.30|> As I mentioned before,<|7.24|>

207
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,539
<|7.24|> we're really seeing pockets of adoption<|9.44|>

208
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:24,759
<|9.44|> across the entire industry.<|11.66|>

209
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,000
<|11.66|> I'm often asked, you know,<|12.90|>

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,799
<|12.90|> which sub verticals do you see AI adoption in finance?<|16.70|>

211
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,599
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> I think it's much less about subverticals,<|2.80|>

212
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,880
<|2.80|> but much more about the culture<|5.08|>

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,959
<|5.08|> that our customers have really engendered, right?<|8.16|>

214
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,919
<|8.16|> Which requires a good combination of top-down encouragement<|12.12|>

215
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,559
<|12.12|> and adoption to lower the barriers,<|14.76|>

216
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,320
<|14.76|> but also a bottoms-up experimentation culture, right?<|18.52|>

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,599
<|18.52|> To try all of these tools out there to figure out what makes sense.<|21.80|>

218
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:59,000
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> With that in mind, I think some of the main customers that we've seen strong adoption from, BCI for example,<|7.40|>

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,359
<|7.40|> they've sort of fundamentally transformed the way they work.<|10.76|>

220
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:09,399
<|10.76|> There are these things called comps analysis that analysts do, which basically means you're comparing comps,<|17.80|>

221
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,640
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> financial and operational metrics for all of these different companies<|3.24|>

222
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,760
<|3.24|> to figure out whether they're trading at the right value.<|6.36|>

223
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,520
<|6.36|> Analysts do this statically in one Excel sheet<|9.12|>

224
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,000
<|9.12|> that they refresh manually every week, every quarter.<|12.60|>

225
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,119
<|13.52|> Instead of doing that, BCI has instead used our artifact feature<|17.72|>

226
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:30,600
<|17.72|> to connect directly to S&P and FactSet datasets<|21.20|>

227
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,599
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> so that the artifact is a live dashboard<|3.00|>

228
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,979
<|3.00|> of how these metrics compare against each other.<|5.38|>

229
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,979
<|5.38|> And with one simple prompt to Claude,<|7.38|>

230
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,739
<|7.38|> you can easily update it.<|9.14|>

231
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,059
<|9.14|> And these artifacts are also shared<|10.46|>

232
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,519
<|10.46|> with their managing directors<|11.92|>

233
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,559
<|11.92|> who are directly interfacing with these platforms as well.<|15.96|>

234
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,639
<|15.96|> So I think we're really seeing not just acceleration of work,<|20.04|>

235
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,699
<|20.04|> but way for the work to actually be transformed<|23.10|>

236
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,700
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> Memory is such a fundamental piece of how humans basically exist in the world, right?<|5.00|>

237
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,299
<|5.00|> You have to memorize things to like know where you put your keys last, for example.<|8.60|>

238
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:05,299
<|8.60|> How are we building that into our models?<|11.60|>

239
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:08,000
<|11.60|> And why is that important for financial services?<|14.30|>

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,299
<|14.30|> The way that we think about how we work with our customers, as I mentioned before,<|18.60|>

241
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,900
<|18.60|> there's very little that we can internally test for these finance use cases.<|23.20|>

242
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,100
<|23.20|> It's to, again, work really closely with enterprise customers<|26.40|>

243
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,799
<|26.40|> to understand where things are working with or not, right?<|29.10|>

244
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,799
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> And memory systems is something that's really important<|3.00|>

245
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,959
<|3.00|> to allow Claw to understand and maintain context<|6.16|>

246
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,959
<|6.16|> across all of these different tools and surfaces that it works in.<|10.16|>

247

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
<|17.20|> the ability to understand patterns,<|19.40|>

251
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,960
<|5.00|> All of these things are really important to just make sure that Claude stays<|8.76|>

252
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,919
<|8.76|> and in turn that continually gets better through his interactions with you.<|12.72|>

253
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,239
<|12.72|> And so like over time, you could imagine someone prompting the model like,<|16.04|>

254
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,440
<|16.04|> "Hey, you got this formula slightly wrong."<|18.24|>

255
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,000
<|18.24|> And then Claude has some way of storing that memory, whether it be a file system or it's implicit.<|23.80|>

256
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,500
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> et cetera, which is pretty awesome.<|2.50|>

257
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
<|2.50|> I'm excited for that.<|3.50|>

258
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,020
<|3.50|> Or if the user and analyst really wants to use S&P<|8.02|>

259
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,320
<|8.02|> for a specific piece of EBITDA calculation,<|11.32|>

260
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,919
<|11.32|> Cloud should remember those preferences<|12.92|>

261
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,320
<|12.92|> to just like a good intern.<|15.32|>

262
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,900
<|15.32|> Cool, so we've talked a lot about Cloud for Finance.<|17.90|>

263
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,260
<|17.90|> I'm curious, in your opinion,<|19.26|>

264
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,700
<|19.26|> what's next for our product and research orgs<|21.70|>

265
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,440
<|21.70|> in relation to making Cloud better for finance?<|24.44|>

266
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,179
<|24.44|> You know, take a step back.<|26.18|>

267
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:35,299
<|26.18|> Anthropic is enterprise focused, enterprise first.<|29.30|>

268
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:41,799
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> The only way for us to deliver outcomes to the enterprise is to focus on specific domains.<|6.50|>

269
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,940
<|6.50|> Finance is one of the most important domains for Anthropic across the entire stack.<|11.64|>

270
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,080
<|12.40|> Research, product, and go-to-market.<|14.78|>

271
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:58,619
<|15.16|> Starting with research, we're finally starting to invest in both specific pre-training and post-training for finance.<|23.32|>

272
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,819
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> On the product side, three things I'm really excited about.<|3.72|>

273
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,779
<|3.72|> One is going much deeper into specific sub verticals.<|8.68|>

274
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,739
<|8.68|> Private equity has very different needs<|10.64|>

275
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:13,119
<|10.64|> from hedge funds and insurance firms and investment banks.<|14.02|>

276
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,319
<|14.02|> We want to really start understanding and peeling back<|16.22|>

277
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,000
<|16.22|> the nuances of those workflows<|17.90|>

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,399
<|17.90|> and make sure that the components<|20.30|>

279
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,160
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> we're building fully serve those workflows.<|2.76|>

280
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,640
<|2.76|> We're also excited about the ability to have cloud everywhere,<|6.24|>

281
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,720
<|6.24|> right? Not just in the browser,<|8.32|>

282
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,360
<|8.32|> but within Excel, within PowerPoint.<|10.96|>

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,080
<|10.96|> On PowerPoint and Excel,<|12.68|>

284
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,000
<|12.68|> I think we still have a lot of room to improve the quality of those outputs.<|16.60|>

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> So excited to work again really closely with research<|3.20|>

286
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,500
<|3.20|> and bring these capabilities into the product.<|5.50|>

287
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,200
<|5.50|> On the partnership side,<|7.20|>

288
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,700
<|7.20|> it's really important for us to work closely with the industry.<|10.70|>

289
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
<|10.70|> It's been really encouraging to see<|12.70|>

290
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,000
<|12.70|> the fact that MCP servers have only been out for six months<|16.00|>

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,080
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> And major industry leaders like S&P and Faxed have already published functional, great versions of their own MCP servers.<|8.08|>

292
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:05,580
<|8.48|> We want to keep bringing the industry together, including some of the recent announcements we've made.<|13.58|>

293
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,679
<|13.58|> The last piece is working really closely with our enterprise customers.<|17.68|>

294
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,700
<|19.34|> Fundamentally, that's how we work together to translate what their needs are.<|24.70|>

295
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,200
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> and help us build the research and product capabilities to meet those needs.<|4.50|>

296
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,700
<|4.50|> I definitely agree with that because not everyone comes from a financial services background like you,<|9.00|>

297
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,700
<|9.00|> at Anthropic, and so I feel like we learn the most from the customers that we're going deep with.<|14.00|>

298
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:37,700
<|14.00|> Specifically when they're like designing evals, for example, that gives us so much signal about how the model actually works in production.<|21.00|>

299
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,799
<|21.00|> And I think that level of collaboration is what we're going after with Cloud4Finance.<|26.10|>

300
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,099
<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> I think that's the main thing I would encourage our enterprise customers to think about.<|4.30|>

301
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:51,599
<|4.30|> You know, evals sound like these mystical concepts, but they're really simple.<|8.80|>

302
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:55,599
<|8.80|> They are tasks you care about and problems you want to solve<|12.80|>

303
00:16:55,599 --> 00:17:00,099
<|12.80|> and an articulation of what good looks like for those tasks.<|17.30|>

304
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:05,300
<|17.30|> It's really important for enterprise customers to be thoughtful about these problems<|22.50|>

305
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,600
<|startoftranscript|><|transcribe|><|0.00|> rather than thinking about,<|1.30|>

306
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,400
<|1.42|> oh, I need to infuse AI into every part of my business.<|4.10|>

307
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,220
<|4.34|> And that's how we can partner really closely<|5.92|>

308
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,180
<|5.92|> with enterprise customers.<|6.88|>

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,220
<|7.20|> We bring those evals directly into the training process,<|9.92|>

310
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,020
<|10.34|> directly into the product pipeline,<|11.72|>

311
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,000
<|11.90|> so that we can deliver these capabilities<|13.70|>

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,080
<|13.70|> to our customers.<|14.78|>

313
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,040
<|15.34|> 100%.<|15.74|>

314
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,739
<|15.74|> Well, thank you so much, Nick.<|17.44|>

315
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,800
<|17.48|> This was fantastic.<|18.50|>

316
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,080
<|18.84|> Appreciate you taking the time.<|19.78|>

317
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,160
<|19.98|> Thanks for having me, Alexander.<|20.86|>
